</dyad-problem-report><think>**Reflecting on the Error**

I've got a TypeScript error in `DailyTasksV2.tsx`! It seems I'm passing `createSection` to `TaskList`, but that prop isn't declared in `TaskListProps`. This is after I removed section management from `TaskList.tsx` in a prior update. I must have missed updating the component props.


**Diagnosing Prop Mismatch**

I've pinpointed the root cause: a missing prop declaration in `TaskListProps`. Specifically, I neglected to update the `TaskListProps` interface after refactoring section management. Now, I'm going to rectify this by adding the necessary props to the `TaskListProps` interface in `TaskList.tsx`, including `createSection`, `updateSection`, `deleteSection`, and more.


</think>You're right, my apologies! I missed updating the `TaskListProps` interface in `src/components/TaskList.tsx` when I moved the section management logic.

I'll add the necessary props to the `TaskListProps` interface to resolve this compile-time error.
